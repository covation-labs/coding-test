I hope to make a humble request, you see, i am not a B.Tech graduate yet, and so, would not be available for full time, but i was hoping you would consider me for the role of a part-time intern in your organization. Let me be a contributing member to your workforce all the while improving my skills while working on real world projects under your mentorship

I hope my lack of experience does not deter you from picking me as the right choice for the position, after all everyone has to start somewhere
